<p>A couple of weeks ago, I came across the <a href="https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/">research blog</a> of Gregory Gundersen. Gregory Gundersen is a quantitative researcher in New York.</p>

<p>It was quite an exciting experience to see someone’s technical blog whose interest is very similar. Not just because of the topics he addresses, I was captivated by his remarkable way of elaborating mathematical concepts and translating intuitions into plain words. If anyone reads this post, I strongly recommend seeing his <a href="https://gregorygundersen.com">website</a>. It’s amazing.</p>

<p>Then I got curious about how he could manage to continuously create research posts through the arduous daily life of pursuing his Phd. Surprisingly, I could find his motivations and purpose for doing a research blog. You can see the whole story of it in his <a href="https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/">post</a>.</p>

<p>But long story short,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.
<strong><em>Richard Feynman</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote was from the top of the front page of Gregory Gundersen’s blog, and this is the shortest line I’ve ever seen, clearly explains the reason for doing a research blog.</p>

<p>I have seen plenty of blogs managed by talented people worldwide. So I knew it was a meaningful thing to do. Sometimes I get help from it by solving technical issues that irritate me all day or by clarifying the confusing concepts I’m trying to understand.</p>

<p>But hereby, I confess, I’m not the kind of person who can invest a significant portion of one’s time in writing only to explain something he already knows for community contribution.</p>

<p>The reason I started this blog is just the opposite. I write to understand what I’m studying. I write to digest what I’ve learned and derive the true meaning of it. This is the easiest way I have found to understand something and prove that you know something.</p>

<p>So, Let’s get started.</p>
