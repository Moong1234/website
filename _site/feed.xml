&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I came across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/&quot;&gt;research blog&lt;/a&gt; of Gregory Gundersen. Gregory Gundersen is a quantitative researcher in New York. It was quite an exciting experience to see someone’s technical blog whose interest is very similar. Not just because of the topics he addresses, I was captivated by his remarkable way of elaborating mathematical concepts and translating intuitions into plain words. If anyone reads this post, I strongly recommend seeing his &lt;a href=&quot;https://gregorygundersen.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got curious about how he could manage to continuously create research posts through the arduous daily life of pursuing his Phd. Surprisingly, I could find his motivations and purpose for doing a research blog. You can see the whole story of it in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But long story short,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. 
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote was from the top of the front page of Gregory Gundersen’s blog, and this is the shortest line I’ve ever seen, clearly explains the reason for doing a research blog. At the beginning of my Master’s program, I started this blog as Gregory Gundersen did. I hope this deepens my knowledge and keeps me on track. I believe this is the simplest way to learn something and prove that you know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">tags: blogging, writing</summary></entry></feed>
