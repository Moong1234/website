A couple of weeks ago, I came across the [research blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/) of Gregory Gundersen. Gregory Gundersen is a quantitative researcher in New York. It was quite an exciting experience to see someone's technical blog whose interest is very similar. Not just because of the topics he addresses, I was captivated by his remarkable way of elaborating mathematical concepts and translating intuitions into plain words. If anyone reads this post, I strongly recommend seeing his [website](https://gregorygundersen.com). It's amazing.

Then I got curious about how he could manage to continuously create research posts through the arduous daily life of pursuing his Phd. Surprisingly, I could find his motivations and purpose for doing a research blog. You can see the whole story of it in his [post](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/).

But long story short, 

>I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. 
***Richard Feynman***

This quote was from the top of the front page of Gregory Gundersen's blog, and this is the shortest line I've ever seen, clearly explains the reason for doing a research blog. At the beginning of my Master's program, I started this blog as Gregory Gundersen did. I hope this deepens my knowledge and keeps me on track. I believe this is the simplest way to learn something and prove that you know it.

So, Let's get started.
